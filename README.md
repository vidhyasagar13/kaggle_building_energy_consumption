# kaggle_building_energy_consumption
In this project, the improvements of energy consumption is focussed with the ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III dataset obtained from kaggle platform. The lightGBM model (a Microsoft open source library) is constructed on this dataset to predict the meter_reading. At first to get the important predictor variables, the exploratory data analysis part is executed. After gathering enough information, the model is constructed and the dataset is given to train the model. This model gets trained and the dataset is given for prediction. The resultant prediction values is then exported in the required format.
